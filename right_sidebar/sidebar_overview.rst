The digiKam main window has a sidebar at the right border providing important information and actions of the selected images. This same sidebar is also available in the digiKam Image Editor (except the **Filters** tab). It can be displayed by respectively clicking on one of the eight tabs:

    - :ref:`Properties <properties_view>`: File and image properties, key shooting parameters.

    - :ref:`Metadata <metadata_view>` : EXIF, Makernotes, IPTC, XMP, and ExifTool data.

    - :ref:`Colors <colors_view>` : Histograms and embedded ICC profiles.

    - :ref:`Maps <maps_view>` : View to show GPS location.

    - :ref:`Captions <captions_view>` : Comments, Date & Time setting, Labels, Rating, Tags, selected metadata.

    - :ref:`Versions <versions_view>` : Image history.

    - :ref:`Filters <filters_view>` : Filters to apply to icon-view selection.

    - :ref:`Tools <tools_view>` : An optional contextual view dedicated to group by categories all main tools available.

Clicking successively onto the same tab will make the sidebar pop up or fold back into the border.
