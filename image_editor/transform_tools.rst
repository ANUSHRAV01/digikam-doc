Cropping a Photograph
---------------------

Manual Crop
~~~~~~~~~~~

Cropping a photograph is not only a common operation, but an often underestimated photographer's tool to compose an image. The Image Editor makes it very easy. To crop a photograph simply drag a rectangle over the image by holding down the left mouse button and moving the mouse. You will see a wire frame rectangle appear as you move the mouse.

When you release the button the area of the photograph that will be removed by a crop operation is greyed out. This allows you to get a good view of how your photograph will look once you have cropped it. You can change the size of the cropped area by dragging the corners of the rectangle, and you can create a new crop area simply by dragging out another rectangle.

Once you are happy with the crop, click on the The Image Editor Crop Button button on the toolbar and the photograph will be cropped (Ctrl+X). Use the File → Save or File → Save As... entries in the File menu to save the newly cropped photograph. 

.. note::

    The Histogram tab from the right sidebar will recompute the color statistics accordingly with the current selection on image.
