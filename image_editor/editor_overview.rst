digiKam incorporates a fast Image Editor with a few basic yet powerful image editing tools. You can use the Image Editor to view your photographs and to make corrections and alterations. The Image Editor can be accessed either by clicking on a thumbnail in the Image Window or by clicking with the right mouse button over a thumbnail and selecting Edit from the context menu.

The Image Editor provides a number of powerful tools that use you to adjust a photograph.
