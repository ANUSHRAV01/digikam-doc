Blur FX
-------

The digiKam Blur FX is a series of blurring effects for digital still images.

With this filter set, you can transform an ordinary photograph into a work of art suitable for framing using blurring operations.

These are the blurring effects available:

    **Zoom Blur**: blurs the image along radial lines starting from a specified center point. This simulates the blur of a zooming camera, thereby giving the photograph a dynamic expression as often seen in sport photography.

    **Radial Blur**: blurs the image by rotating the pixels around the specified center point. This simulates the blur of a rotating camera.

    **Far Blur**: blurs the image to simulate the effect of an unfocused camera lens. The subject seems to recede into the background.

    **Motion Blur**: blurs the image by swishing the pixels horizontally. This simulates the blur of a linearly moving camera, i.e. like a shot taken from a car or train.

    **Focus Blur**: blurs the image corners to reproduce the astigmatism distortion of a lens.

    **Softener Blur**: blurs the image softly in the darker tones and strongly in the high lights. This gives photographs a dreamy and glossy soft focus effect (Hamilton effect). It's ideal for creating romantic portraits, glamour photography, or adding a warm and subtle glow.

    **Shake Blur**: blurs the image by randomly moving the pixels simulating the blur of an arbitrarily moving camera.

    **Smart Blur**: finds the edges of color in photograph and blurs them without muddying the rest of the image.

    **Frost Glass**: blurs the image by simulating randomly dispersing light filtering through hoarse frosted glass.

    **Mosaic**: blurs the image by dividing the photograph into rectangular cells and then recreates it by filling those cells with average pixel value.

.. warning::

    Some effects can take a long time to run and cause high CPU load. You can always abort an effect by pressing the Abort button during preview rendering.

Charcoal Drawing
----------------

The digiKam Charcoal is an effect filter that creates a charcoal sketch-like result.

The digiKam Charcoal filter uses the gradients of color and luminosity to produce a grey scale charcoal sketch. The lines defining the outline of the image are pronounced. Images with slowly changing gradients are not ideal for this effect. It is helpful to imagine what scene you would pick to do as a hand sketch yourself, in order to choose the image to start with.

.. figure:: images/editor_charcoal.png

There are two sliders to control the effect on a scale of 1-100. The upper slider selects the pencil size, whereas the second slider adjusts the contrast (smoothness).

.. note ::

    The result can be improved by adjusting the luminosity levels.
