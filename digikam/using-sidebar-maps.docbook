        For navigating on the map refer to &marble; handbook, Chapter 2. The meaning of <quote>GPS</quote> and functions and buttons that apply to all three geolocation parts are described in the <link linkend="tool-geolocationeditor">Geolocation Editor</link> chapter of this handbook. This applies to the context menu on the map and the line of buttons under the map except the last one.

    <para>
        For information about the different map services you can use the drop-down field under the line of buttons. Choose a service here and then click the See-more-information-on-the-Internet button to the right.
    </para>

    <para>
        The displayed positioning data are actually stored in the image's EXIF tags. That allows the location to be read by any other application that can understand EXIF GPS data.
