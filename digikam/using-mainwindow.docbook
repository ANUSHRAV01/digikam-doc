        <para>&digikam;'s main window has four areas. The first one is a sidebar in the left margin that lets you switch between 4 views: <guibutton>Albums</guibutton>, <guibutton>Dates</guibutton>, <guibutton>Tags</guibutton> and <guibutton>Searches</guibutton>. Then there is a tree navigator panel showing the selected view. The main image window is right in the center. And on the right hand side there is another <link linkend="using-sidebar">sidebar</link> shown. This one can be used to show all information about your images. You can use all these views to organize and find your photographs.
        </para>
        <para>To unclutter the interface, either toggle the sidebars away with a &LMB;, or use the full screen view mode (F11, Ctrl+Shift+F).</para>
        <para>Drag and Drop of images works about everywhere: d&amp;d an image into another branch of the album tree, across the horizontal album separation line, or to another application window. The only restriction is that you cannot d&amp;d into tag, date or searches.</para>

        The &quot;Albums&quot; tree provides an organized view of your photograph albums. All photographs that are managed by &digikam; are stored in a single folder branch. The albums can be sorted by their folder layout on the hard disk, by the Collection name that has been set in the Album Properties or by the Date of that Albums (this date can also be changed in the Properties of each Album).

            There are a number of ways to create a new Album. You can create a new Album when you upload new photographs from the Camera using the Camera Tool. You can also create a new empty Album by clicking the <guibutton>New</guibutton> button on the tool bar. As an additional option, you can create a new Album by importing an existing folder of photographs from your computer; just select <menuchoice><guimenu>Import</guimenu> <guimenuitem>Add Folders...</guimenuitem></menuchoice> from the menu bar and select the folder that you want to import. An Album will be created with the same name as the hard disk folder. You can use drag and drop to import a folder. Drag a folder icon, for example from a &konqueror; window. Then drop it on the album list on the left. A menu will appear that gives you the option to move or copy the folder into &digikam;.

However, sometimes you may want to add a photograph that you already have on your computer to an existing Album. To add a photograph to an Album, make sure that the Album is selected. Then, either click the <guilabel>Add Images</guilabel> icon in the tool bar or select <menuchoice><guimenu>Import</guimenu> <guimenuitem>Add Images...</guimenuitem></menuchoice> from the menu bar. Select the photographs that you want to add from the file dialog and click <guilabel>Open</guilabel>. The photographs will be copied into the Album.

Album Collections are different from photograph tagging because the Album Collection applies to all the photographs in an Album rather than to individual photographs. You can use both Album Collections and tagging to organize your photographs.

            <para>
            Many digital cameras now have an orientation sensor. This sensor can detect how you hold the camera while taking an image. It stores this orientation information inside the image. This meta data is stored in an embedded meta-data section called EXIF. The cameras could rotate the image themselves right away, but they have limited processing power, so they leave this job to an application like &digikam;. If the camera is storing the orientation, then &digikam; can use it to automatically rotate your photographs so that they are the correct way up when you display them. &digikam; will rotate the image on disk according to this orientation information.
            </para>

            <para>
            The photograph is rotated without loss of quality and the orientation information is set to normal, so that other EXIF-aware applications will handle it correctly. To use this feature, right-click on the thumbnail and select

        (Hierarchical) tagging provides a flexible and powerful way to organize and catalog your images. Tags are labels that can be applied to individual images or whole groups. Once a tag has been set to an image it can be found again by selecting the tag or doing a search.

      <para>When a tag is selected, all of the images that are marked with that tag are displayed.     </para>

      <para>
         Tags can be arranged in a hierarchical tree. This allows you to organize your tags in a logical manner. One can collapse parts of the tree in the &quot;Tags&quot; list so that one can easily find the tags that you are looking for.
      </para>

             <tip>
              <para>Tags are stored in a database for fast access, and, the applied tags are written into IPTC data fields of the image (at least for JPEG). So can use your tags with other programs or, in case of loss of that data in the database, the tags will be re-imported when the image is noticed by &digikam;.</para></tip>

         <para>
           You can move the position of a Tag within the tree by dragging it to the position that you want and dropping it there. A menu will appear that gives you the option to

         <para>
           Before you can get the most out of &digikam;'s Tagging capabilities, you must first tag your photographs. There are two methods of tagging photographs. Once you have identified the photographs that you want to tag you can either drag and drop them onto the Tag in the "My Tags" tree or, by right-clicking on the selected photographs in the Image Window, you can use the <guilabel>Assign Tag</guilabel> menu to select the Tags you wish to set.
         </para>

         <para>
           You can label a photograph with as many tags as you like. The photograph will appear when you select any of the tags that are set against it. This way you can set a tag for each person in a photograph, as well as the place the photograph was taken, the event it was taken at, &etc;

            <para>
            Quick Search is a little box in the status bar and provides you with a simple means to search all data fields in the album library with a single query. You can enter any arguments in the <guilabel>Search</guilabel> text field and it will be used to determine the results. For instance, you can enter the string 'birthday' to search the complete album library for occurrences of the word 'birthday' in all photograph descriptions, or '05.png' to search for a specific image file name '05.png' (no escaping as in regexpressions needed).

            </para>

            <para>
            The Quick Search really works intuitively. If you want to search images from a certain date, you can simply type <userinput>2005</userinput>, but it is even possible to search for a certain month. Just enter the name of the month in your local language. If it is Dutch, you can enter <userinput>Maart</userinput>, to see the images of March. The combination of 'Maart 2006' means 'Maart AND 2006' and therefore is equivalent to '2006 Maart'. Or look for 'Maart 2007 cr2' to find all RAW files of March 2007.

            <para>Next to the search box is a little LED that turns green if the search has results. Just click on it to reset the filtering and show all images again. If the search is not succeessful, the LED turns red.</para>
