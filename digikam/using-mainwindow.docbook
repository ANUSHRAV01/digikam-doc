        <para>
            &digikam;'s main window has two areas in the center showing your photograhps. One is the <firstterm>Icon Area</firstterm>, showing thumnails of the content of the selected album or of a search result, and the other one the <firstterm>Preview</firstterm>, showing the selected image. Together let's call them the <link linkend="using-imagearea">Image Area</link>. In the top left corner of the Preview we have a few buttons for moving back and forth through the content of the album, for rotating the image, for showing or adding face tags and to switch to fullscreen mode. By clicking on the preview you can make it disappear and by clicking on the picture area of a thumbnail open it again.
        </para>

        <para>
            The Image Area in the center is surrounded by the menu bar and the <link linkend="maininterface-toolbar">Main Toolbar</link> at the top, the <link linkend="maininterface-statusbar">Status Bar</link> at the bottom and the Left and <link linkend="using-sidebar-intro">Right Sidebar</link>. The Left Sidebar lets you switch between eight <quote>Views</quote>: Albums (shown here), Tags, Labels, Dates, Timeline, Search, Fuzzy (Search) and People (Tags). The Right Sidebar can be used to show all informations about your images and partly also to edit them. You can use all these views to organize and find your photographs. If you click on one of the buttons on the sidebars there will fold out another area, offering possibilities to select, to make inputs, &eg; for searches, to edit data and to show informations.
        </para>

        <para>
            Don't worry if your main window looks quite different at the moment. You will soon learn how to switch the different areas on and off and at some point you might get a look very similar to the above screenshot.

            Drag and Drop of images works about everywhere: d&amp;d an image into another branch of the album tree, across the horizontal album separation line, or to another application window. The only restriction is that you cannot d&amp;d into tag, date or searches.

                Note that there can be a problem with meta-data embedded in photographs when they are edited by other image manipulation applications. Some applications do not retain the photograph's meta-data when you save a modified image.

        <title>Lossless Image Rotation</title>

            <note><para>
                There is a difference between rotating a photograph in one of the Views of &digikam; or in the Image Editor. The Image Editor uses a different method of rotating an image, you may not notice any difference but the Image Editor method can cause some loss of quality in the photograph when saving the picture as JPEG. The rotation methods described here preserve the original quality of the photograph also in JPEG - Files.
            </para></note>

            <para>
                &digikam; provides two ways to get your photographs the right way up. The simplest method is to click one of the rotate - icons on the thumbnail or the preview (or to right-click for the context menu and select <guilabel>Rotate</guilabel> and then pick the direction of rotation needed.

                    </menuchoice> 
                from the menu bar. Most digital cameras have an orientation sensor. This sensor can detect how you hold the camera while taking an image. It stores this orientation information inside the image. This meta data is stored in an embedded meta-data section called EXIF. The cameras could rotate the image themselves right away, but they have limited processing power, so they leave this job to an application like &digikam;. If the camera is storing the orientation, then &digikam; can use it to automatically rotate your photographs so that they are the correct way up when you display them. &digikam; will rotate the image on disk according to this orientation information.
            </para>

            <para>
                The photograph is rotated without loss of quality and the orientation information is set to normal, so that other EXIF-aware applications will handle it correctly. The <link linkend="camerainterface.anchor">Import Tool</link> can perform this operation automatically when it uploads the photographs from your camera which will ensure that your photographs are always the right way up. The rotate operation will do nothing if your camera does not include this information in the photos.

            (Hierarchical) tagging provides a flexible and powerful way to organize and catalog your images. Tags are labels that can be applied to individual images or whole groups. Once a tag has been set to an image it can be found again by selecting the tag or doing a search.

        <para>
            Tags can be arranged in a hierarchical tree. This allows you to organize your tags in a logical manner. One can collapse parts of the tree in the &quot;Tags&quot; list so that one can easily find the tags that you are looking for.
        </para>

        <tip>
            <para>
                Tags are stored in a database for fast access, and, the applied tags are written into IPTC data fields of the image (at least for JPEG). So can use your tags with other programs or, in case of loss of that data in the database, the tags will be re-imported when the image is noticed by &digikam;.

            <para>
                Quick Search is a little box in the status bar and provides you with a simple means to search all data fields in the album library with a single query. You can enter any arguments in the <guilabel>Search</guilabel> text field and it will be used to determine the results. For instance, you can enter the string 'birthday' to search the complete album library for occurrences of the word 'birthday' in all photograph descriptions, or '05.png' to search for a specific image file name '05.png' (no escaping as in regexpressions needed).

            <para>
                The Quick Search really works intuitively. If you want to search images from a certain date, you can simply type <userinput>2005</userinput>, but it is even possible to search for a certain month. Just enter the name of the month in your local language. If it is Dutch, you can enter <userinput>Maart</userinput>, to see the images of March. The combination of 'Maart 2006' means 'Maart AND 2006' and therefore is equivalent to '2006 Maart'. Or look for 'Maart 2007 cr2' to find all RAW files of March 2007.

                Next to the search box is a little LED that turns green if the search has results. Just click on it to reset the filtering and show all images again. If the search is not succeessful, the LED turns red.
