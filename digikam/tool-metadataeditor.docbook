<title>Metadata Editor</title>

<para>
    Inside each digital photo hides metadata in the Exif, Iptc, or Xmp formats, and &digikam; provides tools for viewing and editing this useful information.
</para>

<para>
    The application offers metadata editing tools available through the <guimenu>Edit Metadata</guimenu> menu entry. 
    The metadata editor conveniently organizes all metadata into sections for each kind of metadata chunk, making it easier to find and edit 
    specific entries. For example, to edit hardware-related information, switch to the <guilabel>Device</guilabel> section. Here you can modify device manufacturer, 
    device model, exposure-related settings, and other information.

</para>

<para>
    In addition to Exif, IPTC and XMP formats are supported, so you can perform the described actions on metadata stored in these metadata chunks as for Exif.
    Remember that Exif is dedicated to store camera information, where Iptc and Xmp are more used to store post process text information as rights management.
    So, it's not recommended to edit the metadata that the camera creates but more to add the author/copyright/&etc; information, excepted if you need to fix wrong
    internal values.

    </inlinemediaobject>
</para>

<para>
    Note that you can synchronize some specific metadata entries from one chunk to another one, as for example the comments which is available into 
    Exif, Iptc, and Xmpp as different forms. When relevant checkbox are set in the section, relevant chunk entries are backported and adjusted in most 
    compatible format.
