       <sect2 id="using-about">
       <title>About &digikam;</title>

       <para>
       &digikam; is an advanced digital photo management application for the &kde; desktop. It provides a simple interface which makes importing and organizing digital photographs a &quot;snap&quot;. &digikam; enables you to manage large numbers of digital photographs in Albums and to organize these photographs for easy retrieval using tags, collections, dates and searches. It has many features for viewing, organizing, processing and sharing your images.
       </para>
    
       <para>
       An easy-to-use Camera interface is provided, that will connect to your digital camera and download photographs directly into &digikam; Albums. More than <ulink url="http://www.gphoto.org/proj/libgphoto2/support.php">800 digital cameras</ulink> are supported through the gphoto2 library.
       </para>
       
       <para>&digikam; incorporates a fast Image Editor with many image editing tools. You can use the Image Editor to view your photographs, comment and rate them, correct, enhance and alter them. The editing power can be easily extended by a set of plugins, the <ulink url="http://www.kipi-plugins.org">Kde Image Plugins Interface</ulink> (<ulink url="help:/kipi-plugins/index.html">manual</ulink>) 
       </para>

       <para>While &digikam; remains easy to use, it provides professional level features by the dozens. It is fully 16 bit enabled including all available plugins, supports RAW format conversion through David Coffins dcraw and ICC color management work flow.
       </para>
       
       </sect2>

       <sect2>
       <title>Reporting Bugs</title>

       <para>
       Like the rest of &kde;, &digikam; is an Open Source project. This means that it relies on its users to play their part by, at least, reporting problems and suggesting possible improvements.
       </para>

       <para>
       &digikam; makes it as easy as possible for you to report bugs or suggest improvements. Wherever you are in the application the Help menu will include a Report Bugs option. This will display a message box with a highlighted link. Click on the link and your web browser will open the page for the reporting system. All the information required will already be filled in, just follow the instructions for completing your report.
       </para>
       </sect2>

       <sect2>
       <title>Support</title>
      
       <para>
       &digikam; is a community supported project, which means that users and developers support one another. If you become a regular user of &digikam; you are encouraged to join the &digikam; Users Mailing List. You can start off by asking questions of other &digikam; users and hopefully soon you will be answering the support questions of others.

       <title>Getting Involved</title>

       <para>
       There are many ways that you can get involved with the continued development of &digikam;. You do not need to be a software developer. You can help with documentation, translation and user interface design or just contribute really good ideas to the wish-list. You can also get involved by testing early development code as it is being developed and providing feedback to the developers. Of course, if you are a software developer then you can help to make &digikam; the best digital photograph application there is. 
       </para>

       <para>
       The best way to start getting involved with &digikam; is to join the Developers Mailing List.

           </inlinemediaobject></para>
        
        <para>
        When you start &digikam; for the very first time it will ask you where you store your photographs. You can type in the path name of a folder or click on the <guilabel>folder</guilabel> icon
        <inlinemediaobject>
            <imageobject><imagedata fileref="&path;introductionfoldericon.png" format="PNG"/></imageobject>
            <textobject> <phrase>Folder Icon</phrase> </textobject>
        </inlinemediaobject>
        to select a folder from the dialog.
        </para>
        </sect2>

        <sect2>
        <title>The Scan Items Dialog</title>

        <para>
        If you already have a collection of photographs on your hard disk, you can enter the top-level folder containing the photographs, this is called the Albums Library folder. &digikam; will treat each sub-folder of the folder you've entered as an Album. None of the photographs will be altered. During folders parsing you can see a progress dialog like this:
        </para>
        <para>
          <inlinemediaobject> <imageobject>
            <imagedata fileref="&path;introductionscandialog.png" format="PNG" /> </imageobject></inlinemediaobject>
        </para>
        </sect2>
        <sect2>
        <title>The Albums Missing Dialog</title>
        <para>This parsing for modifications happens at every application start-up, but it can be disabled in the <guilabel>Settings</guilabel> under <guilabel>Miscellaneous</guilabel>
	</para>
	<para>
          As &digikam; uses your folders on your hard disk directly, other applications like file managers can remove any albums outside a &digikam; session. In this case &digikam; will tell you at the next session if all albums that have been removed from the &digikam; photographs root path shall be deleted from albums database. If you want to move folders around and do not want to do that in &digikam;, we suggest you do that while &digikam; is running, so the database will be kept in sync and you do not lose any metadata.
        </para>
        <para><inlinemediaobject><imageobject> 
                <imagedata fileref="&path;introductionalbumsmissingdialog.png" format="PNG" />

              <textobject><phrase>The Albums Missing Dialog</phrase></textobject></inlinemediaobject>
        </para>

        <para>
        When you use an existing folder of photographs, as the Album Library folder, you will notice that the Albums in the Album list do not have photographs as their icons. The first time you view each Album &digikam; will create a thumbnail from the first photograph in the Album and use this as the Album icon. See the <link linkend="using-myalbumsview">Album</link> section for details of how to change the Album icon.
        </para>

        <para>
        If you have previously accessed your photograph collection with another application, that has created thumbnails in non-standard sub-folders, &digikam; will show these thumbnail folders as separate Albums. &digikam; follows the <ulink url="http://www.freedesktop.org/">freedesktop.org</ulink> standards for thumbnail folders. There is no way of hiding non-standard thumbnail folders from the &quot;Albums&quot; list. If you want to keep them you could create an Album Collection that just contains all the thumbnail Folders and then view your Albums in By Collection order. See the <link linkend="using-myalbumsview">Album</link> section for more about Album Collections.
        </para>

        <para>
        Once you have configured the Album Library Folder you can setup &digikam; to work with your digital camera. Then learn how to use <link linkend="using-myalbumsview">Albums</link> and <link linkend="using-mytagsview">Tags</link> to arrange your photograph Albums.

 <sect1 id="using-pluginssupport">     <title>Supported Plugins</title>

        <para>
        One of the nicest things about &digikam; is how easily its functionality can be extended, by using plugins:
        
        <itemizedlist>
            
                <listitem><para><emphasis>Kipi Plugins</emphasis>: the <ulink url="http://www.kipi-plugins.org">Kde Image Plugins Interface project (kipi)</ulink>  (<ulink url="help:/kipi-plugins/index.html">manual</ulink>) is an effort to develop a common plugin structure for &digikam;, <application>KPhotoAlbum</application>, <application>Showimg</application> and <application>Gwenview</application>. Its aim is to share image plugins among graphical applications. Kipi Plugins setup is described in this <link linkend="setup-kipiplugins">section</link>.</para></listitem>

        <para>                                                    
         Plugins can manipulate images in almost any way that users can. Their advantage is, that it is much easier to add a capability to &digikam; by writing a small plugin than by modifying the &digikam; core.

            <para>
            Current digital cameras are characterized by the use of <emphasis>Compact &Flash; Memory</emphasis> cards and <emphasis>USB</emphasis> or <emphasis>FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-link)</emphasis> for data transmission. The actual transfers to a host computer is commonly carried out using the <emphasis>USB Mass Storage</emphasis> device class (so that the camera appears as a disk drive) or using the <emphasis>Image Transfer Protocol (PTP)</emphasis> and its derivatives. Older cameras may use the <emphasis>Serial Port (RS-232)</emphasis> connection.

            <para>
            &digikam; employs the <emphasis>gPhoto2</emphasis> program to communicate with digital still cameras. gPhoto2 is a free, redistributable set of digital camera software applications which supports a growing number of over 800 cameras. gPhoto2 has support for the <emphasis>Image Transfer Protocol</emphasis>, which is a widely-supported protocol developed by the International Imaging Industry Association to allow the transfer of images from digital cameras to computers and other peripheral devices without the need of additional device drivers.
            </para>
            
            <para>
            Many old digital still cameras used <emphasis>Serial Port</emphasis> to communicate with host computer. Because photographs are big files and serial port transfers are slow, this connection is now obsolete. &digikam; supports these cameras and performs image transfers using the gPhoto2 program. You can find a complete list of supported digital cameras at this <ulink url="http://www.gphoto.org/proj/libgphoto2/support.php">url</ulink>.

            The &quot;Albums&quot; tree provides an organized view of your photograph albums. All photographs that are managed by &digikam; are stored in a single folder branch. The albums can be sorted by their folder layout on the hard disk, by the Collection name that has been set in the Album Properties or by the Date of that Albums (this date can also be changed in the Properties of each Album).

                There are a number of ways to create a new Album. You can create a new Album when you upload new photographs from the Camera using the Camera Tool. You can also create a new empty Album by clicking the <menuchoice><guimenu>View</guimenu> </menuchoice> button on the toolbar. As an additional option, you can create a new Album by importing an existing folder of photographs from your computer, just select <menuchoice><guimenu>Album</guimenu> <guimenuitem>Import</guimenuitem> <guimenuitem>Import Folders</guimenuitem></menuchoice> from the Menu Bar and select the folder that you want to import. An Album will be created with the same name as the hard disk folder. You can use drag and drop to import a folder. Drag a folder icon, for example from a &konqueror; window. Than drop it on the album list on the left. A menu will appear that gives you the option to move or copy the folder into &digikam;.

                Many digital cameras now have an orientation sensor. This sensor can detect how you hold the camera while taking a image. It stores this orientation information inside the image. This meta data is stored in an embedded meta-data section called EXIF. The cameras could rotate the image themselves right away, but they have limited processing power, so they leave this job to an application like &digikam;. If the camera is storing the orientation, then &digikam; can use it to automatically rotate your photographs so that they are the correct way up when you display them. &digikam; will rotate the image on disk according to this orientation information.

                The photograph is rotated without loss of quality and the orientation information is set to normal, so that other EXIF-aware applications will handle it correctly. To use this feature, right-click on the thumbnail and select

           Before you can get the most out of &digikam;'s tagging capabilities you must first tag your photographs. There are two methods of tagging photographs. Once you have identified the photographs that you want to tag you can either drag and drop them onto the tag in the &quot;Tags&quot; tree or, by right-clicking on the selected photographs in the Image Window, you can use the <guilabel>Assign Tag</guilabel> menu to select the tags you wish to set.
         </para>

         <para>
           You can label a photograph with as many tags as you like. The photograph will appear when you select any of the tags that are set against it. This way you can set a tag for each person in a photograph, as well as the place the photograph was taken, the event it was taken at, &etc;.

                <para>
                Quick Search provides you with a simple search form to search all data fields in the album library with a single query. You can enter any arguments in the <guilabel>Search</guilabel> text field and it will be used to determine the results. For instance, you can enter the string 'birthday' to search the complete album library for occurrences of the word 'birthday' in photograph description, or '05.png' to search for a specific image file name '05.png' (no escaping as in regexpressions needed).

                <para>
                The Quick Search really works intuitively. If you want to search images from a certain date, you can simply type <userinput>2005</userinput>, but it is even possible to search for a certain month. Just enter the name of the month in your local language. If it is Dutch, you can enter <userinput>Maart</userinput>, to see the images of March. The combination of 'Maart 2006' means 'Maart AND 2006' and therefore is equivalent to '2006 Maart'. Or look for 'Maart 2007 cr2' to find all RAW files of March 2007.

        Another mode is better suited for quickly culling from a series of images. If you choose <guilabel>Navigate by Pair</guilabel> from the toolbar, the first two images will be automatically inserted into the comparison panes. Click on any thumbnail to make it the left side preview, the adjacent thumbnail to the right will be inserted into the right pane. That make it easy to sift through a series of similar images.

        <title>Comments &amp; Tags</title>
           <para>
           This sidebar tab serves to apply and edit image attributes like comments, rating, date and tags. The attributes are stored in the associated database, in the IPTC and EXIF data fields and become part of the image. All attributes are accessible in one sidebar view as shown in the screenshot below. During image reading the order of priority is a) database b) IPTC and c) EXIF. So if there is a discrepancy between any of the three, this priority will take effect and a synchronization will take place. This sidebar has a first-previous-next-last arrow navigator field on top if shown in the main application.

          <title>Comment View</title>
           <para>
           The comment view can be used to type or paste in a comment of unlimited size (see note below). The text is UTF-8 compatible, meaning that all special characters are allowed. The comments are copied to EXIF and IPTC comment fields to be used from other applications.
           </para>
           <caution><para>
           The IPTC data does only support ASCII characters and 2000 characters at most (old American norm). All comments will be truncated after 2000 chars, and special characters will be malformed. If you intend to use the IPTC comment field in other applications you should be compliant with these restrictions.

           In the Date &amp; Time section, which reflects the time of taking the photograph, you can change all values. From the date combo-box a calender opens, and the time setting spin-box can also be written by directly typing the time. The dating is copied to the EXIF 'Date and Time' field. If you need to change a number of images for their creating time &amp; date, there is a more comfortable method available (requiring the kipi-plugins). This latter option can be found under <menuchoice><guimenuitem>Image</guimenuitem><guimenuitem>Adjust time &amp; date...</guimenuitem></menuchoice>. Select the images to be changed in the main view and call the plugin.

          <title>Rating</title>

           <para>
           The Rating section displays a 0...5 star rating scheme that can be used in searches and sort orders. It can be applied by a single mouse click to the 5 stars in the sidebar or with a keyboard short-cut Ctrl+0...5. The rating from the sidebar is always applied to one image at a time. To rate a number of images, select them and pop-up the context menu (right-click) to apply a common rating.
           </para>
           <para>The rating is then transcribed into the IPTC 'urgency' data field. The transcoding follows the scheme in this table:

          <title>Tag Tree</title>

           <para>
           The tag view shows an adaptive filter tag search box, the tag tree and a combo-box containing the tags previously applied in this &digikam; session.
           </para>
           <para>
           The tag tree will be adapted dynamically as a function of the search word as you type into the box. So it is easy to quickly reduce the number of possibilities when searching for a tag. Of course, this feature is only useful if you have many tags.
           </para>

           <para>
           The combo-box at the bottom is another ergonomic feature for easy tagging of an image series. As you apply different tags they will be memorized in this box for quick access. 
           </para>

           <para>
           Otherwise tags are simply applied by checking the respective boxes in the tree. All tags of an image are transcribed into the IPTC 'keyword' data field.
           </para>
           <note><para>
            In case you have selected a number of images in the main view and you check a tag in the tag tree, this one is only applied to the highlighted image, and not to the whole selection. If you want to tag selections, refer to the <link linkend="using-sidebartagfilters">Tag filters</link> section.

        <title>Tag Filters</title>
           <para>
           The tag filter sidebar is used to modify the set of images displayed in the main window view. Normally one uses the left sidebar with its Album, Date, Tags and Searches view. When additionally one or more tags on right sidebar tag filter is checked, only the cross-section of these two selections will be displayed. All created tags are available. 
           </para>
           <para>
           To give an example, suppose you have a tag called 'public' which tags all images except your private ones. Then you can check this 'public' tag in the right sidebar to hide the private images (all those not having 'public' tag). Whatever view mode you chose from the left sidebar, 'public' only image will be displayed. Another typical example is the selection of a subset of tags in a hierarchical tree. Suppose you want to display 'red' and 'green' from a tag tree containing 7 different colors as sub-tags. Simply click on the 'color' tag of the main view and check 'red' and 'green' from the right sidebar.
           </para>
           <para>Another use is <emphasis>drag-and-drop tagging</emphasis>. Lets say you selected in the main view a number of images to tag them. If the tag already exists, simply drag it from the right sidebar onto the selection (any one of the highlighted images). A dialog will pop-up and ask if this tag should be applied.
           </para>

           </para>

            <para>
                In the above example the main window shows the images from a calender date, the tag filter is set to 'not tagged', which reduces the set to 3 images. They have been selected with Ctrl+a, then a tag is dragged from the right tag tree over the selection and dropped. A pop-up dialog asks if the tag shall be applied.

            Please note that there is no way to restore a photo that you have deleted from the camera. The photographs are not moved to the &kde; Trash Can, they are removed completely. It is best to double check that you have successfully downloaded a photograph into a &digikam; Album before you delete it from the camera. Anyway, if you plan to empty the camera card, you better do that from the camera menu because it is much quicker.

            &digikam; can automatically rename your photographs using the date and time information included by the camera in the photograph. To use this feature, click the <guilabel>Settings</guilabel> button on the Camera Interface. The Camera Interface window will expand to reveal some extra features. Select <guilabel>Customize</guilabel> and then enter any filename prefix you would like. As an option you can then add the date &amp; time, a sequence number or a combination of both.

                Not only for professional photographers can it be interesting to link an image to a precise geographical location. Not everybody uses an airplane to overfly and scan a certain area with automatic GPS data recording. Environmental planners, military, police, construction bureaus, real estate agencies, all will have an immediate application.
            </para>
            <para>
                But if, after some time, one has forgotten where the image was taken, if one loves the nice feature to open with a simple click a browser displaying a zoom of the area, if you like to send your image as a postcard to another &digikam; user (who is then able to locate your shot), or if you simply need the documentation aspect of it - having position data stored in a photo is great.

                Now, how do we get GPS data into the images? First it is to say that <ulink url="http://www.exiv2.org/tags.html">exif2</ulink> supports many kinds of the GPS data fields, even bearing, satellite and map references. So the question is really how to get the data into those fields? There are at least three ways to do this: directly with the appropriate hardware, per post-treatment of GPS and image files using the <ulink url="http://www.kipi-plugins.org">Geolocalization</ulink> (<ulink url="help:/kipi-plugins/geolocalization.html">Manual</ulink>) kipi-plugin and per 'manual' insertion of known locations.

                        The approach is dead easy: whilst taking your images just keep a GPS device running and carry it around with the camera. Once you are done, download the images and the GPS tracks, and run the above plugin. It will correlate the data in the time domain; so it is important that the camera be accurate in its clock setting (the GPS device is always accurate through the satellites). The positional accuracy interpolated from the track points can be as good as 20 meters. Of course, this approach only works if your camera can record EXIF data.

If you want to permanently rotate the image on file, you can right-click on the thumbnail and select <guilabel>Auto-rotate/flip according to EXIF orientation</guilabel>.

                When changes are made to JPEG files and they are saved back to the hard disk the JPEG file must be re-encoded. Each time a JPEG file is encoded a decision must be made on the level of quality that is to be applied. Unfortunately the level of quality applied is not recorded in the image file. This means that the Image Editor cannot use the same quality ratio when saving an altered image as was used for the original image. You can change the default level of quality that the Image Editor will apply when it saves altered images by moving the <guilabel>JPEG quality</guilabel> slider  (1: low quality / 100: high quality and no compression).

                With <guilabel>PNG compression</guilabel> option, you can reduce PNG image files size. This operation does not reduce image quality because PNG uses a lossless algorithm. The only effect is that image data needs more time to compress/decompress. If you have a fast computer you can change this value for to use a high compression factor (1: low compression / 9: high compression).

At the time of writing, metadata is not yet supported, but it is in the 'pipeline'.

                <para>If enabled, all RAW files will be decoded to 16-bit color depth using a linear gamma curve. To prevent dark image rendering in the editor, it is recommended to use Color Management in this mode. If disabled, all RAW files will be decoded to 8-bit color depth with a BT.709 gamma curve and a 99th-percentile white point. This mode is faster than 16-bit decoding. In 8-bit mode only will the <guilabel>brightness</guilabel> setting be taken into account (dcraw limitation).

                <para><guilabel>Highlights</guilabel></para>
                <para>This is the story of the three highlight options, courtesy to <ulink url="http://linux.vilars.com/">Nicolas Vilars</ulink> :</para>
                <para>Default is here to consider highlights (read: part of your images that are burned due to the inability of your camera to capture the highlights) as plain / solid white (<guilabel>solid white</guilabel> option). You can get some fancy results with the <guilabel>unclip</guilabel> option which will paint the highlights in various pinks. At last you can try to consider recovering some parts of the missing information from the highlights (<guilabel>reconstruct</guilabel> option).</para>
                <para>
                  This is possible because the blue pixels tends to saturate less quickly than the greens and the reds. &digikam;/dcraw will try to reconstruct the missing green and red colors from the remaining none saturated blue pixels. Of course here everything is a question of tradeoff between how much color or white you want.</para>
                <para>If you select <guilabel>reconstruct</guilabel> as the option, you will be given the choice to set a level. A value of 3 is a compromise and can/should be adapted on a per image basis.</para>
                <note><para>
                   A small warning here, for the few curious that have read the man pages of Dcraw, the author says that 5 is the compromise, 0 is solid white and 1 unclip. This is because in &digikam; 0 and 1 are the "solid white" and "unclip" options in the drop down menu (if you select these, the level slider will be grayed out). Therefore, the slider in Digikam with the "reconstruct" option will let you choose between 0 to 7 (instead of 0 to 9 in Dcraw command line) where 3 is the compromise instead of 5 in "native" Dcraw command line tool.</para></note>

                <para><guilabel>Brightness</guilabel> (works in 8 bit mode only)</para>
                <para>
                  Set the luminosity to your taste, you probably need to go a little higher than the default = 1. But this can be adjusted later with the image options in the Digikam image editor. Given the cost in time for demosaicing, stay conservative.
                </para>

                <para><guilabel>Quality</guilabel></para>
                <para>
                  A <ulink url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demosaicing">demosaicing</ulink> algorithm is a digital image process used to interpolate a complete image from the partial raw data received from the color-filtered image sensor internal to many digital cameras in form of a matrix of colored pixels. Also known as CFA interpolation or color reconstruction.</para>
                <para>
                  &digikam; and Dcraw offer us three alternatives: bi-linear, VNG interpolation, AHD interpolation. It seems that <emphasis>AHD interpolation</emphasis> (for Adaptive Homogeneity-Directed) is the best choice for quality according to some test that I have performed and the paper of the person that implemented it. <emphasis>VNG interpolation</emphasis> (Variable Number of Gradients) was the first algorithm used by Dcraw but suffers from color artifacts on the edge. <emphasis>Bilinear</emphasis> is interesting if you are looking for speed with a acceptable result.</para>

                 <para><guilabel>Enable Noise Reduction</guilabel></para>
                 <para>
                   While demosaicing your image, you can additionally ask for noise reduction (at a speed penalty). This option applies a noise reduction algorithm while the image still is in CIE Lab color space. Because the noise is only applied to the Luminosity layer (the "L" of the Lab), it should not blur your image as traditional noise reduction algorithms do in RVB mode. So, if you converted an image from RAW and it appears noisy, rather than applying a denoiser, go back and re-convert with this option enabled. The defaults are: <emphasis>Domain</emphasis> = 2 and <emphasis>Range</emphasis> = 4.

                 &digikam; has the ability to color manage your images. RAW files are not color managed at all. Your camera provides the data it has captured in a raw format and will let you manage all the processing. Every camera has its specifics regarding how it captures color information, therefore you will need to apply a specific profile to the images you want to process. Please refer to the section <link linkend="using-iccprofile">ICC color profile management</link> for more details an explanations.
              </para><para>
                 Basically, a profile "maps" the color information and gives information on how one should render them. It gives also information to LCMS and &digikam; on how to translate the color information from one color space to an other in order to keep the colors as accurate as possible.

            <para>
            &digikam; incorporates a fast Image Editor with a few basic yet powerful image editing tools. You can use the Image Editor to view your photographs and to make corrections and alterations. The Image Editor can be accessed either by clicking on a thumbnail in the Image Window or by right-clicking on a thumbnail and selecting <guilabel>View/Edit</guilabel> from the context menu.
            </para>

            <para>
            The Image Editor provides a number of tools that enable you to adjust a photograph. Some of these tools are provided by plugins to &digikam;. So they may not be available by default on your distribution. See the <link linkend="setup-kipiplugins">Setup Image Editor Section</link> for more details about Kipi-plugins.

        <sect2>       <title>Restoring Your Original Photograph</title>

            <para>
            The editing functions of the Image Editor will make changes to your photograph. None of the editing functions will change the original photograph unless you select 
            <menuchoice><guimenu>File</guimenu>
            <guimenuitem>Save</guimenuitem></menuchoice> 
            or click the <guilabel>Save</guilabel> button in the toolbar. Note that once you have saved the changed version you will not be able to recover the original photograph.
            </para>
        
            <para>
            You might prefer to take a copy of your photograph before you make any changes. You can use 
            <menuchoice><guimenu>File</guimenu>
            <guimenuitem>Save As</guimenuitem></menuchoice> 
            to save a working copy.
            </para>
            
            <para>
            At any time <emphasis>before</emphasis> you save your photograph you can restore the view to the original image by selecting 
            <menuchoice><guimenu>File</guimenu>
            <guimenuitem>Revert</guimenuitem></menuchoice> 
            or clicking the 
            <inlinemediaobject>
                <imageobject><imagedata fileref="&path;editorrevertbutton.png" format="PNG"/></imageobject>
                <textobject><phrase>The Image Editor Revert Button</phrase></textobject>
            </inlinemediaobject>
            <guilabel>Revert</guilabel> button on the toolbar. You will lose any changes that you have made to the photograph since it was last saved.
            </para>
            
        </sect2>

        <sect2>       <title>Undoing/Redoing Actions</title>
            
            <para>
            Almost anything you do to an image in Image Editor can be undone/redone. You can undo the most recent action by choosing <menuchoice><guimenu>Edit</guimenu><guimenuitem>Undo</guimenuitem></menuchoice>, and redo by <menuchoice><guimenu>Edit</guimenu><guimenuitem>Redo</guimenuitem></menuchoice>
            </para>
            
            <para>
            If these are done so frequently that you really should memorize the keyboard shortcuts, <guilabel>&Ctrl;-Z</guilabel> to undoing action, and <guilabel>&Ctrl;-Shift-Z</guilabel> to redoing action.
            </para>

            <para>
            You have to press the &LMB; over the undo or redo icon in the toolbar and hold it down for a moment to produce a context menu. If you choose one of the menu items, all undo/redo actions until the chosen ones are undone/undone.
            </para>
                        
        </sect2>
        
        <sect2>       <title>Moving Between Photographs</title>
            
            <para>
            Once you have started the Image Editor you can move between photographs in the same Album or Tags view by using the navigator buttons on the toolbar or the entries in the <guilabel>File</guilabel> menu. If you have made any changes to the current photograph you will be asked if you want to save them.
            </para>
        
        </sect2>

        <sect2>       <title>Changing the View</title>

            <para>
            You can zoom in and out of a photograph using the 
            <inlinemediaobject>
                <imageobject><imagedata fileref="&path;editorzoombuttons.png" format="PNG"/></imageobject>
                <textobject> <phrase>The Image Editor Zoom Buttons</phrase> </textobject>
            </inlinemediaobject> buttons on the toolbar or the entries in the View menu.
            </para>
            <para> 
            To make a photograph fit the window use this button on the toolbar:<guilabel>Zoom Autofit</guilabel> 
            <inlinemediaobject>
                <imageobject><imagedata fileref="&path;editorautosizebutton.png" format="PNG"/></imageobject>
                <textobject> <phrase>The Image Editor AutoFit Button</phrase> </textobject>
            </inlinemediaobject>
            </para>

            <para>
            <menuchoice><guimenu>View</guimenu>
            <guimenuitem>Toggle Full Screen</guimenuitem></menuchoice> will display the photograph using the full screen mode. You can move back to the normal view by pressing the <keycombo><keycap>Esc</keycap></keycombo> key. By default the toolbar is still displayed even in Full Screen Mode. If you would prefer that the toolbar is not displayed you can turn it off in the Configure &digikam; dialog accessed from the main &digikam; window, see the <link linkend="setup-editor">Setup Image Editor Section</link>.
            </para>
        
         </sect2>

        <sect2>       <title>Printing Images</title>

            <para>
            When you want to print the current image from the Image Editor, select 
            <menuchoice><guimenu>File</guimenu>
            <guimenuitem>Print image</guimenuitem></menuchoice> (&Ctrl;+P) and you get the standard &kde; Print dialog, where you can adjust the settings before printing your photograph.
            </para>         
            
            <para>
            For more information about advanced printing settings, please consult <ulink url="help:/kdeprint/index.html">&kde; Print manual</ulink>.
            </para>

           <para>
                From the main window view you can print single images or whole sets of them. Entire thumbnail pages can be printed with your selection. All you need to do is selecting images the standard way and call <menuchoice><guimenu>Album</guimenu><guimenuitem>Export</guimenuitem> <guimenuitem>Print Wizard</guimenuitem></menuchoice>. Then follow the instructions and choices to make.
