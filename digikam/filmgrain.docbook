<title>Introduction</title>

<para>
The &digikam; image plugin <emphasis>Filmgrain</emphasis> is an easy tool to produce film grain on your 
images as known from classical high speed film material as, for example, the famous B/W KodaK Tri-X. 
In order to increase film sensitivity, manufacturers employed larger silver grains in the photo emulsion. 
</para>

<para>
The film grain effect gives your shot a particular mood or seems to transport it in time. The treated 
image acquires a timeless atmosphere, detached from every day life. If you want that gritty, art-house, 
street-photography grainy film look, especially in monochromatic photos, use this plugin.

<title>Using the plugin</title>

<para>
There is a slider calibrated in ISO-sensitivity to control the grain intensity and granularity. The 
default is set to ISO-2400, although higher values are often required. If you still want more grain, 
apply the filter several times.
