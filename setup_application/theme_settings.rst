    The digiKam Color Themes Menu

When theme is selected all elements from the graphical interface must change accordingly with the colors scheme.
    
.. note::

    Depending of the color theme used, it must be mandatory to restart application to load relevant icons-set working with colors scheme.

    Pairing some application colors scheme and widget style can give a wrong user experience. We recommend to adjust if necessary the **Widget Style** from the **Setup / Misc / Appearance** configuration panel, especially with dark color schemes. See :ref:`this section <appearance_settings>` from this manual for more details about the **Appearance** options.
