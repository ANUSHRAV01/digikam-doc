Overview

.. contents::

digiKam tries to give you as much control over how it works as possible. There are many options that change the behavior of the application. To access these settings select :menuselection:`Settings --> Configure digiKam...` from the menubar. The configuration dialog is separated by categories displayed in independant pages. You can change between these pages by clicking on the icons on the left-hand side of the dialog.

.. note::

    If you press **Ok** button, the configuration will be saved in your home directory and applied to the current application session. Next Session will re-use the same settings. If you press **Cancel**, nothing will be changed.
