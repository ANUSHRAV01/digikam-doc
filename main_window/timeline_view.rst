    The Timeline View

The Timeline View shows a timescale-adjustable histogram of the numbers of images per time unit which is selectable by a drop down field. To the right of that you can choose between a linear or logarithmic histogram. A selection frame moves over the histogram. To display the photographs out of a certain time frame just click on the corresponding bar. You are not restricted to one bar. With Shift+left click or Ctrl+left click you can add more bars to the first one.

    Timeline Selection Screencast

In the field right below you can enter a title and save your selection. It will then appear in the “Searches” list field below. But the best is still to come: the Timeline View offers a search for a search! If you have a lot more searches saved than my ridiculous four in the screenshot the adaptive search field at the bottom may help to find a certain search.
