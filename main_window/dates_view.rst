Dates View
----------

.. figure:: images/mainwindow_datesview.webp

The Dates View organizes your photographs based on their dates. digiKam uses either the Exif date or, if no Exif date is available, the last modification time of the file.

When you select a month from the list, all images from that month are displayed in the Image Area. You can select days or weeks in the date sheet at the bottom of the Left Sidebar to show only the images from the selected dates.
