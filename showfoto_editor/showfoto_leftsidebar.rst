Left Sidebar
============

.. contents::

Left sidebar in Showfoto is the main difference in user interface of Showfoto compared to digiKam Image Editor. As Showfoto do not provide any advanced functionalities about Digital Asset Management as digiKam has, at least **Folders** and **Stack** give to the user the essential capabilities to explore, reference, and access quickly to your preferred photo contents on your computer.

Folders Tab
-----------

The **Folders** tab is a complete view to handle your system directory hierarchies, as a desktop file-manager. It divided in 3 views from the top to the bottom:

    - **Navigation settings** view providing:

        - A tools-bar on the top to navigate on the directories hierarchies, return to your personal folder, adjust the thumbnail size, and two buttons to access to advanced settings and manage the current folder contents with the **Stack** and Slideshow tools.

        - An editable combo-box showing the current directory path and the history of previous places visited from this tab.

        - A combo-box where you can apply a type-mime filter to restrict the thumbnails list to the desired file formats.

    - **Thumbnails list** where you can show the image files properties from the current selected folder set in directory combo-box behind. With the tools-bar on the top and with the context menu, you can adjust the flat list settings and assign content to the **Places** or to the **Stack**

    - Your preferred **Places** (Bookmarks).
