Left Sidebar
============

.. contents::

Left sidebar in Showfoto is the main difference in user interface of Showfoto compared to digiKam Image Editor. As Showfoto do not provide any advanced functionalities about Digital Asset Management as digiKam has, at least **Folders** and **Stack** give to the user the essential capabilities to explore, reference, and access quickly to your preferred photo contents on your computer.

The **Folders** tab is a complete view to handle your system directory hierarchies, as a desktop file-manager.

    The Showfoto Stand-Alone Editor Folders Tab from Left Sidebar

It divided in tree views from the top to the bottom:

    - **Navigation settings** view providing:

        - A tools-bar on the top to navigate on the directories hierarchies, return to your personal folder, adjust the thumbnail size, and two buttons to access to advanced settings and manage the current folder contents with the **Stack** and Slideshow tools.

        - An editable combo-box showing the current directory path and the history of previous places visited from this tab.

        - A combo-box where you can apply a type-mime filter to restrict the thumbnails list to the desired file formats.

    - **Thumbnails list** where you can show the image files properties from the current selected folder set in directory combo-box behind. With the tools-bar on the top and with the context menu, you can adjust the flat list settings and assign content to the **Places** or to the **Stack**. Double clicking on a item from the list load the contents to the canvas.

    - Your preferred **Places** (Bookmarks). This view is optional and can be disabled in the settings available from thumbnails list context menu or in tools-bar from on the top. **Bookmarks** reference your preferred places that you register when navigating on the folder hierarchies. **Bookmark** properties includes a **Path**, an **Icon**, and a **Title**. these properties can be modified later creation. The **Usual Places** is a read-only group to give a quick access to the standard folders from your personal directory.

    The Showfoto Stand-Alone Editor Stack Tab from Left Sidebar

It divided in two views from the top to the bottom:

    - **Thumbnails list** showing the current stack contents. You can access to the lead features from this view by the context menu available by a right click button of the mouse. Stack contents can be tuned from this context menu, or from the **Folders** tab. When you are agreed with the stacked items on this list, you can register the container as a **Favorite**.

    - **Favorites** tree-view is a list of tour preferred stack classified using a hierarchy (similar than tags from digiKam). This hierarchy can host nested **Favorite folders** to host your stacks (**Favorite item**). You can edit stack properties which includes **Name**, **Type**, **Description**, **Creation Date**, **Icon**, and the list of **Stacked items**. Double clicking on a item from the hierarchy plug the stack contents to the thumbnails list on the top. If any, the last opened file from the stack is loaded in the canvas else the first from the list.
