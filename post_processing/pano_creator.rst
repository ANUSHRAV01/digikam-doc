One of the most exciting tools available in digiKam and Showfoto is the Panorama tool. Which is simple and quite effective.

Select the images that you want to stitch and go to Tools -> Stitch images into a panorama and the wizard open up.

Panorama stitching is now done. If you want you can now save your project. The same project files can be used in hugin, if I'm not mistaken, since this tool uses hugin! Click Next and you will see the output in the same folder as your original pictures. Here is what I got.
