    The Panorama Creator Wizard Pre-Processing Stage

The option **Detect moving skies** allows an automatic detection of clouds to prevent wrong key-points matching between images due to moving shapes. To be more precise, during the control points selection, the process discards any points that are associated to a possible cloud. This is useful to prevent moving clouds from altering the control points matching process do by the algorithms. Depending of the scene contents, turn on the option and press **Next** button to pre-process items.
