The **Timestamp Used** allows to select the source of the date. Available choices are listed below:

    - **digiKam timestamp**: the date recirded in database.
    - **File name timestamp**: the date extracted from the filename.
    - From the file system: **File last Modified** will use the last modification date of file.
