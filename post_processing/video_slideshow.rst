Video Slideshow
===============

The Video Slideshow tool allows to create a movie from a list of photos. Generated file can be played in a video player or a TV screen. Images are presented one by one with visual effects if you need. This tool can also be used to create a time-lapse animation from shots taken with an intervalometer.

Select the images that you want to stitch and go to :menuselection:`Tools --> Create video slideshow` a wizard dialog will open up as below.

    The Video Slideshow Wizard Welcome Page

This page allows to select the contents to export: from current items selection, or from a list of albums. With the **Albums** selection mode you can generate video slideshow from Albums contents. Just check the respective Albums displayed with hierarchical nesting. On the next three tabs **Tags**, **Searches**, and **Labels** you can refine your selection using tags, labels, or previous search results in digiKam.

If you uses the **Images** selection mode only the previous selection of items from Icon-View will be processed and listed on this page as a flat list.
