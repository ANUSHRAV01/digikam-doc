    The digiKam Maintenance Options to Detect and Recognize Faces

This is the same process you can access in the **People** view with the **Scan Collection for Faces** button. Here you just cannot set the **Fast - Accurate** parameter but just the **Face Data Management** method and the option to **Clear and rebuild all training data**. For more information about the **Faces Data Management** options see :ref:`the People View section <people_view>`.
