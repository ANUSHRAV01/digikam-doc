This is the same process you can access in the People View with the **Scan Collection for Faces** button. Here you just cannot set the Fast - Accurate parameter but just the **Face Data Management** method and the option to **Clear and rebuild all training data**. For more information about the Faces Data Management options see :ref:`the People View section <people_view>`.
