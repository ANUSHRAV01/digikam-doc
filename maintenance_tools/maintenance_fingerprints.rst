Rebuild Fingerprints
====================

.. contents::

.. figure:: images/maintenance_rebuild_fingerprints.webp

Fingerprints are necessary for finding duplicates and similar items and for finding images by sketches. For detailed description see :ref:`the Similarity View section <similarity_view>`.

This process provides only one option to rebuild the contents in the database: **Scan for Changed or Non-Cataloged Items**. This option will run the rebuild faster to prevent to process already register items in database.

.. note::

    This process can also be called from the Similarity View from left sidebar by the button **Update Fingerprints**.

While the rebuild fingerprints process is under progress, notification on the bottom right of main windows will be visible to indicate the amount of items already done.
