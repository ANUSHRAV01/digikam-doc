.. contents::

Visit `the download page <https://www.digikam.org/download/>`_ of the digiKam Web site for up to date information on installing stable **digiKam**.

Youâ€™ll find all previous digiKam versions in the `attic <https://download.kde.org/Attic/digikam/>`_.

Minimum System Requirements
---------------------------

- **Operating System**: 64-bit Windows 7 or newer, Apple macOS 10.13 (High Sierra) or newer based on Intel or M1 architecture, 64-bit Linux. Details see below.

- **CPU**: x86 Intel or AMD; at least one 2 GHz core for standard photo processing, 4 cores for large photo or panorama processing, 8 cores for deep-learning uses as with face detection and image quality sorting. Details see below.

- **GPU**: OpenGL 2.0 that works correctly and is compatible. On Windows, you can also use a card with good, compatible DirectX 9 or 11 drivers.

- **RAM**: At least 4 GB for standard photo processing, 8 GB for large photo or panorama processing, 16 GB for deep-learning uses as with face detection and image quality sorting. Details see below.

.. note::

   If your computer is at the lower end of CPU and RAM requirements, you should use both :ref:`Small Thumbnails Resolution <thumbnails_resolution>` and :ref:`Loading Embedded Preview <preview_resolution>` features to help reduce preview lag.

- **Monitors**: If the application can be used without problem on a single screen, using multi-screens will improve the experience especially with the workflow to review items.

Application Updates
-------------------

.. important::

    If you process a major version update, as for example from version 7 to version 8, we recommend to backup :ref:`your database files <database_intro>`, as generaly internal schema can changes. Typically, digiKam is able to migrate tables from an older version to a new one, and all is done automatically at startup, but in all cases, it's always better to save these importants digiKam files before to upgrade the application.

If you use a bundle as offcial Linux AppImage, macOS package, or Windows installer, the application can be updated using the :menuselection:`Help --> Check For New Version menu entry`. Look also the updates settings :ref:`in Behavior page <behavior_settings>` from the configuration dialog.
