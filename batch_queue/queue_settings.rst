Queue Settings
==============

.. contents::

On the bottom left of the Batch Queue Manager, a view dedicated to host the settings for a queue is available to tune the configurations categorized in five tabs. Batch Queue Manager allows to host many queues to process at the same time on the top left side. Each queue can have a different settings than other one. You switch from one to one by clicking on the wanted queue tab on the top.

.. note::

    With the Workflow feature, you can store your prefered queue settings for a later use. See :ref:`this section <bqm_workflow>` of the manual for details.

Target Album
------------

This view allows to select where the target files processed will be stored. Two choices are possible: at the same album than original files, or a dedicated album. The search field on the bottom allows to filter album tree-view with huge collections.
