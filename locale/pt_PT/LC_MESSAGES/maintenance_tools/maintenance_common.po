"In the Common Options section you can restrict the scope of the maintenance "
"process(es) to certain albums or tags. You got to un-check Whole albums "
"collection or Whole tags collection to get access to the drop down fields "
"where you can select albums or tags. Note that in this drop down field you "
"have a context menu to select or deselect children and/or parents and also "
"to invert the selection. If you switch from Albums to Tags or vice versa "
"your selection in the now grayed out item will remain untouched which might "
"be useful if you need a certain selection more often."
