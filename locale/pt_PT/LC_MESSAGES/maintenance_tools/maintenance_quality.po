"The quality score to determine the Pick Label property can be evaluated by "
"two ways: using four basic factors sabotaging the images (blur, noise, "
"exposure, and compression), or using a deep learning neural network engine. "
"The first one helps to determine whether images are distorted by the basic "
"factors, however it demands some drawbacks as fine-tuning from the user’s "
"side and it cannot work along the aesthetic image processing. The second one "
"uses an IA approach based on `this model <https://expertphotography.com/"
"aesthetic-photography/>`_ to predict the score. As deep learning is an end-"
"to-end solution, it doesn’t require hyper-parameter settings, and make this "
"feature easier to use."
