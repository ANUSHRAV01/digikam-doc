msgid "Hierarchical tagging provides a flexible and powerful way to organize and catalog your images. Tags (also called “keywords” in other applications) are labels that can be applied to individual images or whole groups. Once a tag has been set to an image the image can be found again by selecting the tag or doing a search."

#: ../../main_window/tags_view.rst:18
msgid "Tags can be arranged in a hierarchical tree. This allows you to organize your tags in a logical manner. You can collapse parts of the tree in the “Tags” list so that you can easily find the tags that you are looking for."

msgid "But before assigning and using tags you first have to define them. If you import photographs with tags assigned digiKam will build an appropriate tag tree during import. Other than that you have to define tags by yourself. An easy access to that is the context menu shown in the screenshot above."

A dialog will open where you can type in the tag name (or even a whole hierarchy branch), assign an icon and/or a shortcut to the tag. If you add a new tag by clicking with the right mouse button on an existing tag, your new tag will be created as a sub-tag."

msgid "In this tag tree the keyword \"Cat\" appears three times. This will not cause a problem within digiKam but there are quite a few views where the user cannot know which of the three is applied to an image because he might not be able to see the whole hierarchy of the tag. A help could be to tag the image in a case like this also with the parent tag or even the whole hierarchy but it becomes quite unwieldy, e.g. in the image icon if you have the tags displayed there. The second “Cat” can be avoided by calling it “Wild Cat” but calling the third one “Zoo Cat” is a bit out of the roof, I think. And still: there are also two “Cheetah”!"
msgstr ""

#: ../../main_window/tags_view.rst:68
msgid "Solution: You replace the “Zoo Animal” branch by a single tag “Zoo” which you use in addition to the tag you choose from the two remaining branches. You could even put it on the top level of your hierarchy if you have photographs taken in a zoo but not showing animals."

Once you have identified the photographs that you want to tag you can either drag and drop them onto the tag in the Tags tree or, by clicking with the right mouse button on the selected photographs in the Image Window, you can use the **Assign Tag** menu to select the tags you wish to set."

With the Right Sidebar it works the obvious way: you drag the tag and drop it onto the photograph or selection of photographs you want to tag. With the Left Sidebar you have to drag the photographs to the tags. You want to know why? Just try it the other way and you will see."

The context menu method is obviously very useful if you use only a limited number of tags out of your whole tree for a while."

As an option you could change this behavior, so that delete really will remove the Album and all of the photographs in it. This can be changed by selecting Settings --> Configure digiKam... and selecting the Miscellaneous page. At the top of this page are the settings that control what happens when a photograph is deleted. To delete an Album, click with the right mouse button over the Album in the “Albums” tree and select Delete Album from the context menu."

Click **Captions** tab from the Right Sidebar and then the **Tags** tab and you will see the whole tags tree. Simply check/un-check the boxes of the tags you want to assign/un-assign and then click **Apply**. If you change focus without that you will be asked whether you want to apply the changes unless you disabled that confirmation either by checking **Always apply changes without confirmation** or by checking **Do not confirm when applying changes in the right sidebar** in the Miscellaneous section of :menuselection:`Settings --> Configure digiKam...`. More details about the other buttons and fields in the **Tags** tab see in :ref:`digiKam sidebar <tags_tree>`."
