"This meta data is stored in an embedded meta-data section called Exif. The "
"cameras could rotate the image themselves right away, but they have limited "
"processing power, so they leave this job to an application like digiKam. If "
"the camera is storing the orientation, then digiKam can use it to "
"automatically rotate your photographs so that they are the correct way up "
