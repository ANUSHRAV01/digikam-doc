msgid "We recommend this sequence of image editing steps to ensure optimum photographic quality for the end product. In particular, never do sharpening before the last step. And we recommend using a lossless format like PNG or TIFF for storing photographs. Otherwise you'll lose a bit every time you save the results. If you can afford it, use 16 bit/channel for your best shots. If you want to change color space, in particular if you want to work in CIEL*a*b, 16 bit per channel are required to avoid truncation effects."
