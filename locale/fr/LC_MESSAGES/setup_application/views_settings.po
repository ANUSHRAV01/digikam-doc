The advantage of the preview is that it is faster than opening the image editor and that the icons of the other images remain visible so that you are able to review the list of current images quickly. Depending on your computer features, you can customize the best way to load images into the preview. Raw files can be processed differently, as this kind of container can require long computation."

If an embedded preview cannot be found some image decoders (JPEG, JPEG2000, and PGF, WebP) are able to create a reduced version of the photograph by themselves which is still faster than using the whole image.

The algorithm also takes screen resolution and CPU speed into account to achieve an optimum regarding speed and rendering quality. Embedded preview will try to use the (JPEG) preview embedded in RAW files. Raw data in half size will show unprocessed RAW data in half size."
