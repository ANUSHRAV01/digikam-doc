"**Perceptual**: causes the full gamut of the image to be compressed or "

"is preserved but colorimetric accuracy may not be preserved. In other words, "
"if certain colors in an image fall outside of the range of colors that the "
"output device can render, the image intent will cause all the colors in the "
"image to be adjusted so that the every color in the image falls within the "
"range that can be rendered and so that the relationship between colors is "
"preserved as much as possible. This intent is most suitable for display of "
"photographs and images, and is the default intent."

"intent does not preserve the white point."

"**Absolute Colorimetric**: causes any colors that fall outside the range "
"that the output device can render to be adjusted to the closest color that "

"preserves the white point and is most suitable for spot colors (Pantone, "
"TruMatch, logo colors, etc.)."
msgstr ""

"**Saturation**: preserves the saturation of colors in the image at the "
"possible expense of hue and lightness. Implementation of this intent remains "
"somewhat problematic, and the ICC is still working on methods to achieve the "
"desired effects. This intent is most suitable for business graphics such as "
"charts, where it is more important that the colors be vivid and contrast "
"well with each other rather than a specific color."
