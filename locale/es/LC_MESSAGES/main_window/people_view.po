"As long as you are not just taking pictures from machines or stars or "

"For the task we are talking about you check **Detect faces**, of course. "
"Since face detection is a time-consuming task you better don't hit **Scan** "
"right away, rather **Options**. An additional area will fold out organized "
"with three tabs. In **Search-In** you can confine the scan to certain albums "
"or tags. In **Settings** you can try to find a balance between speed and "
"accuracy that suits your needs. Under Advanced you will find two checkboxes. "

"only if the topmost tag **People** is selected. In the tree you will see a "
"new virtual tag called **Unknown** which will show all those images where "

"This screenshot image have been chosen because it shows one important issue: "

"tag. With **Confirm** you can save that to the database. If it was the only "

"Assigning People tags to face tags is an important prerequisite to Face "
"Recognition. Very obviously digiKam can only recognize faces if it has "
"something to compare with. So it's up to you to show it the ropes, which "
"means in this case to tell digiKam: This is Lara, this is Juan, this is "
"Peter and so forth. For that you would, after performing a Face Detection as "
"described in the previous article, typically select the **unknown** tag on "
"the Left Sidebar, click on a thumbnail and click, if necessary, on the Show "
"Face Tags button |icon_showfacetags|. Now you should see the face tags of "
"that photograph. Those which have a people (or other) tag already assigned "
"will simply show the name of that tag. The others, showing **unknown** "
"faces, will show a field and two buttons as in the screenshot of the "
"previous article. In the field labeled **Who is this?** you can either type "
"in the name of an existing People tag out of your tag tree or use the drop "
"down function to show your tag tree and select a tag. With **Confirm** you "
"can save that to the database."
msgstr ""

#: ../../main_window/people_view.rst:85
msgid ""
"If you use the context menu item **Assign Tag** instead of the procedure "
"described above that will not assign a face tag. It will assign an ordinary "
"tag and it will assign it to the whole image."

"If a face tag is confirmed and thus showing only the name of the tag but not "
"the buttons to remove, edit or confirm it, but you need this buttons because "
"e.g. it's wrong and you want to edit or remove it, just double-click on the "
"name and the buttons will re-appear."

"Once you have a tag assigned to a few photographs you can have digiKam "
"looking if it can find more photographs showing the same face. To prepare "
"that process you click **Scan collection for faces** but this time you "
"select **Recognize faces**."
msgstr ""

"To be able to recognize a new face automatically, a minimum of 4 similar "
"faces tagged in different images need to be previously trained using manual "
"face management workflow."

"Face Recognition is faster than Face Detection but it still makes sense to "
"click **Settings** and confine the scan to certain albums or tags in the "
"Albums tab, e.g. to the **Unknown** tag. In the **Settings** tab we can play "
"with the balance between speed and accuracy and two checkboxes. The first is "
"explained by the text above it."
msgstr ""

#: ../../main_window/people_view.rst:97
msgid ""
"In case of unsatisfying results it might be helpful to use **Clear and "
"rebuild all training data**. One reason can be that there are too many face "
"tags assigned to a person which shows this person in a way that doesn't "
"really help the search algorithm, e.g. with sunglasses, blurred, unusual "
"colors, carnival make up, dark shaded areas in the face, baby/kid/adult "
"photographs mixed... Another reason to use that option can be false face "
"recognition due to a wrong accuracy setting in the **Settings** tab."
msgstr ""

#: ../../main_window/people_view.rst:99

"To start the Face Recognition you click Scan. The process will tag every "
"recognized face with the appropriate People tag out of your tag tree and the "
