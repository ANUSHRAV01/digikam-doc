"A power surge occurs when the power line voltage increases over nominal "

"The most common defense against power surges is a surge protector or "

"diverting the rest of it to the ground. These are usually found in the form "
"of a power strip (one of those long devices that have six or so outlets and "
"a single, grounded plug). Bear in mind, however, that not every power strip "
"serves as a surge protector."
msgstr ""

#: ../../asset_management/data_protection.rst:99
msgid ""
"When selecting your surge protector, you want to be sure it is listed as "
"meeting the UL 1449 standard, which guarantees a certain minimum of "

"Because a power surge can follow any path to your computer, be sure that "
"each peripheral connected to your system is protected. This includes your "
"phone line or cable modem, as power can surge through these routes as well. "

msgstr ""

#: ../../asset_management/data_protection.rst:110
msgid ""
"Besides serving as surge suppressors, these devices automatically switch to "
"battery power when a power outage occurs, giving you the opportunity to save "

"SSDs are mechanically more robust than HDDs and suffer much less on that "

msgstr ""

#: ../../asset_management/data_protection.rst:119

"One major cause for data loss (often recoverable) is the unsafe removal of "

"There is a new technology trend coming up, to replace hard drives with SSD "

"other hand they are susceptible to magnetic fields. Throw a magnet next to a "
"tape and it's gone! Tapes should be re-copied every 5-8 years, otherwise too "
