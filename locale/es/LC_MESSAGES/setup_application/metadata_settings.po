"Show images/thumbnails rotated according to orientation tag : this will use "
"any orientation information that your camera has included in the EXIF "
"information to automatically rotate your photographs so that they are the "
"correct way up when displayed. It will not actually rotate the image file, "
"only the display of the image on the screen. If you want to permanently "
"rotate the image on file, you can click with the right mouse button on the "
"thumbnail and select Auto-rotate/flip according to EXIF orientation. The "
"image will then be rotated on disk and the tag will be reset to \"normal\". "
"If your camera routinely gets this orientation information wrong you might "
"like to switch this feature off."

"Set orientation tag to normal after rotate/flip : the Auto Rotate option "
"automatically corrects the orientation of images taken with digital cameras "
"that have an orientation sensor. The camera adds an orientation tag to the "
"image's EXIF metadata. digiKam can read this tag to adjust the image "
"accordingly. If you manually rotate an image, these metadata will be "
"incorrect. This option will set the orientation tag to \"Normal\" after an "
"adjustment, assuming that you rotated it to the correct orientation. Switch "
"this off if you don't want digiKam to make changes to the orientation tag, "
"when you rotate or flip the image."
