"We are now almost ready to print that image. Where do I get a printer "
"profile? you already know the answer. You can use the generic profile that "
"comes with your printer. You can purchase a professionally produced profile. "
"Some commercial printing establishments will send you their printer profiles "
"(which won't work with your printer). You can make your own printer profile "
"using Argyll, in which case your profile can be tailored to your particular "
"paper, inks, and even image characteristics (if you are printing a series of "
"images with a color palette limited to subdued browns, you don't need a "
"printer profile that tries to make room for saturated cyans and blues)."

"**Rendering intent** refers to the way color gamuts are handled when the "

msgstr ""

#: ../../color_management/printer_profiles.rst:36
msgid ""
"**Perceptual** and **Relative colorimetric** rendering are probably the most "
"useful conversion types for digital photography. Each places a different "
"priority on how they render colors within the gamut mismatch region."

"**Relative colorimetric** maintains a near exact relationship between in "
"gamut colors, even if this clips out of gamut colors."

msgid ""
"In contrast, **Perceptual** rendering tries to also preserve some "
"relationship between out of gamut colors, even if this results in "
"inaccuracies for in gamut colors..."
msgstr ""

#: ../../color_management/printer_profiles.rst:42
msgid ""
"**Absolute** is similar to relative colorimetric in that it preserves in "
"gamut colors and clips those out of gamut, but they differ in how each "
"handles the white point... Relative colorimetric skews the colors within "
"gamut so that the white point of one space aligns with that of the other, "
"while absolute colorimetric preserves colors exactly (without regard to "
"changing white point)..."

"Rendering intents are available when converting from one profile to another "

"Soft-proofing will show you the differences to be expected between what you "

"proof, you need a profile for your printer (actually, for your printer-paper "
"combination, as the paper used affects the ink colors and the white point). "

"**Perceptual** intent may or may not give the best results with soft-proof, "
"depending on the respective gamuts of the image and printer/paper "
"combination in question. Usualy, the **Colorimetric** intents give clearer, "
"brighter colors, albeit at the cost of having to carefully re-edit the image "
"to avoid clipping highlights and shadows. **Perceptual** is just an option, "
"not by any means always *the best* option."

#: ../../color_management/printer_profiles.rst:67
msgid ""
"**Perceptual** rendering intent is a safe choice because it prevents "
"clipping of shadows and highlights, although possibly at the expense of "
"desaturating all your colors. So if you don't want to bother doing any soft-"
"proofing, choose the perceptual rendering intent (if you don't want to soft-"
"proof, probably you should also stick with sRGB)."
