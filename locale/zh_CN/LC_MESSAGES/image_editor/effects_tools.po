"In the age of chemical image processing, solarizing (also known as Sabatier) "

"Velvia is a brand of daylight-balanced color reversal film produced by the "

"In the film industry, 3D lookup tables are used to map one color space to "

"digital projector of how an image will be reproduced on another display "
"device, typically the final digitally projected image or release print of a "
"movie. A 3D LUT is a 3D lattice of output RGB color values that can be "
"indexed by sets of input RGB colour values. Each axis of the lattice "
"represents one of the three input color components and the input color thus "
"defines a point inside the lattice. Since the point may not be on a lattice "
"point, the lattice values must be interpolated; most products use trilinear "
"interpolation."
