"digiKam is color-management enabled. RAW files - as they come - are not "
"color managed at all. Your camera provides the data it has captured in a raw "
"format and will let you manage all the processing. Every camera has its "
"specifics as to how it captures color information, therefore you will need "
"to apply a specific profile to the images you want to process. Please refer "
"to the section ICC color profile management for more details an explanations."

"Basically, a profile \"maps\" the color information and gives information on "
"how one should render them. It gives also information to LCMS and digiKam on "
"how to translate the color information from one color space to an other in "

"You have to provide a workspace profile (linear profiles such as sRGB, ECI-"
"RGB, LStar-RGB, Adobe-RGB or CIE-RGB). If you want to print your images, you "
"may want to opt for Adobe RGB, if it is only for web publishing, sRGB is "
"better (Adobe RGB will be displayed slightly dull in non color managed "
"enabled software such as browsers). However you may change this later of "
"course (by attributing another profile), therefore Adobe RGB can be a good "
"choice for storing and image handling as you can always change it to sRGB "
"before releasing an image for your blog. Note: Do not use non-linear "
"profiles as they will change the color-balance."

"There are some other options such as the soft proof profile which enables "
"you to emulate, granted that you have a profile for it, how your image will "
"render for a particular device. It is useful before printing for instance "
"because your printer has a smaller gamut than your camera and some colors "
"might look saturated. You may want to fix this manually instead of relying "
"on the \"blind\" algorithm of your printer."
