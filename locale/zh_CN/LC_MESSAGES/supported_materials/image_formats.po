"digiKam relies on a number of libraries and support packages to load and "
"save image formats. Which image formats are available will depend on the "
"availability of these libraries on your system and, in some cases, on the "
"way that those libraries have been compiled. On most distributions you will "
"find that a wide range of image formats are viewable within digiKam."

"This dependence on other libraries means that it is not possible to give a "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Image compression is the application of data compression schemes on digital "
"images. It is done through reducing redundancy of the image data in order to "
"be able to store or transmit data in an efficient form."
msgstr ""

#: ../../supported_materials/image_formats.rst:34
msgid ""
"Image compression can be lossy or lossless. Lossless compression methods are "
"always preferred for their high preservation value for archival purposes "
"before applying transformations like cropping, resizing, color corrections, "
"etc. This is because lossy compression methods, especially when used at low "
"bit rates, introduce compression artifacts. Lossy methods are suitable for "
"natural images such as photos in applications where minor (sometimes "
"imperceptible) loss of fidelity is acceptable to achieve a substantial "
"reduction in file size. Lossy compression is good for image publishing on "
"the Internet."
msgstr ""

#: ../../supported_materials/image_formats.rst:37
msgid "JPEG"
msgstr ""

#: ../../supported_materials/image_formats.rst:39
msgid ""
"JPEG is a compressed format that trades some of the image quality to keep "
"file sizes small. In fact, most cameras save their images in this format "
"unless you specify otherwise. A JPEG image is stored using lossy "
"compression, and you can vary the amount of compression. This allows you to "
"choose between lower compression and higher image quality or greater "
"compression and poorer quality. The only reason to choose higher compression "
"is because it creates smaller files so you can store more images, and it's "
"easier to send them by e-mail or post them on the Web. Most cameras give you "
"two or three choices equivalent to good, better, best, although the names "
"vary."

"JPEG 2000 is supported as well. It provides for the same compression ratio "
"with better (smoother) results compared to JPEG. The 2000 version has the "
"option of being lossless if so specified in the settings."

msgid "TIFF"
msgstr ""

#: ../../supported_materials/image_formats.rst:46
msgid ""
"TIFF has been widely accepted and widely supported as an image format. "
"Commonly, TIFF may be stored by the camera in uncompressed form or using a "
"lossless compression algorithm (Deflate). It maintains higher image quality "
"but at the expense of much larger file sizes. Some cameras let you save your "
"images in this format, and it is a popular format because of its lossless "
"compression algorithm. The problem is that the format has been altered by so "
"many people that there are now 50 or more flavors and not all are "
"recognizable by programs."

"PNG is an image format that was developed as a replacement for a number of "
"older, in the 1990's widely used, image file formats. It is a lossless "
"format like TIFF but it is much more compact and saves disk space. Although "
"your camera is unlikely to support PNG, some people like to convert their "
"photographs to PNG as soon as they get them on their computer. Unlike JPEG, "
"PNG images do not lose quality every time you re-encode them after "
"modification. digiKam fully supports PNG images and the Batch Queue Manager "
"can convert a batch of images from any supported format to PNG (and other "
"formats) in one step."
msgstr ""

"PNG is an extensible file format for the lossless, portable, well-compressed "
"storage of raster images. PNG provides a patent-free replacement for GIF and "
"can also replace many common uses of TIFF. PNG is designed to work well in "
"on-line viewing applications, such as the World Wide Web, so it is fully "
"streamable with a progressive display option. Also, PNG can store gamma and "
"chromaticity data for improved color matching on heterogeneous platforms. "
"PNG supports 8 and 16 bits / colors /pixels depth. It's the perfect file "
"format to archive your photographs. For more information about the PNG "
"format `see the PNG homepage <https://www.libpng.org/pub/png/>`_."

msgid ""
"*Progressive Graphics File* is another not so known but open file image "
"format. Wavelet-based, it allows lossless and lossy data compression. PGF "
"compares well with JPEG 2000 but it was developed for speed (compression/"
"decompression) rather than to be the best at compression ratio. At the same "
"file size a PGF file looks significantly better than a JPEG one, while "
"remaining very good at progressive display too. Thus it should be well-"
"suited for photo archiving (digiKam uses this format in database to store "
"thumbnails). For more information about the PGF format `see the libPGF "

msgid ""
"Some, typically more expensive, cameras allow you to store images in RAW "
"format. RAW format is not really an image standard at all. It is different "
"for every make of camera. RAW format images contain all the data that is "
"taken directly from the camera's image sensor before the software in the "
"camera applies things like white balance, sharpening etc. Storing "
"photographs in a camera's RAW format allows you to alter settings, such as "
"white balance, after the photograph has been taken. Most professional "
"photographers use RAW format, because it offers them maximum flexibility. "
"The downside is that RAW image files can be very large indeed."
