"Rebuilding the thumbnails might be necessary if you worked on your images "
"with other applications or if you changed the thumbnail size in Settings --> "
"Configure digiKam... --> Views --> Tree-Views. The “ Scan for changed or non-"
"cataloged items” option can speed up the process in the first case or if you "

"An option from Setup/Views/Icons pannel named **Use Large Thumbnail Size for "
"High Screen Resolution** can be turned on to render icon-view with large "
"thumbnail size, for example in case of 4K monitor is used. By default this "
"option is turned off and the maximum thumbnail size is limited to 256x256 "
"pixels. When this option is enabled, thumbnail size can be extended to "
"512x512 pixels. This option will store more data in thumbnail database and "
"will use more system memory. digiKam needs to be restarted to take effect, "
"and Rebuild Thumbnails option from Maintenance tool needs to be processed "
"over whole collections."
