"digiKam characterizes every image by a lengthy number using a special "
"technique (Haar based processing algorithm) that makes it possible to "
"compare images by comparing this calculated signature. The less numerical "
"difference there is between any two image signatures, the more they resemble "
"each other. This technique has three implementations in digiKam:"

"**Duplicates**: before you can have digiKam finding duplicates the "
"signatures (or fingerprints) have to be calculated. You can start that "
"process with the button **Update Fingerprints** which initiates a total "
"rebuild of the image signatures (may take hours if you have a large "
"collection, an estimate is 2 hours for 10'000 images). Once the fingerprints "
"are calculated you can use **Find Duplicates**, but it will take a long time "
"too as it has to compare every image with any other image. So the way to go "
"in both cases is to confine your search to certain albums and/or tags. With "
"the **Similarity Range** you can narrow down or enlarge the search result. "
"Note that by lowering the upper threshold a little bit below 100 % you can "
"keep things like exact copies, images from series shots, etc. out of the "
"search result if you want."

"An overview of the result will be given in the Left Sidebar. The first "
"column shows the reference images of each single result. The Items column "
"tells you how many images belong to each result including the reference "
"image. The last column shows the average similarity which gives you an idea "
"about how similar the images of every result might be. The reference image "
"with its 100 % is not included in the average. Note that the results can be "
"sorted by clicking on one of the column headers."

"Individual similarity values for each item can be obtained in the table view "
"of the Image Area (**Table** button on the Main Toolbar). Click with the "
"right mouse button over one of the column headers and select **Similarity** "
"from **Item Properties** to display the similarity column. By clicking on "
"the header of this column then the results will be sorted by similarity "
"grouped by reference images. Clicking repeatedly on the header will toggle "
"between ascending and descending order."

"**Image** (Similar items): This is a drag and drop zone where you can drop "
"any image to find a similar one. Drag an image from anywhere, even from "
"outside digiKam (file manager, other programs), over the fuzzy search icon "
"in the left sidebar, it will open and you drop it there or use **Find "
"Similar...** from the context menu of a thumbnail in any other view. You can "
"narrow down or enlarge the resulting selection with the similarity range "
"here as well. In the field below you can enter a name for the search and "
"save it. In the searches list below you find your saved searches. Clicking "
"on the title bar of that list toggles the sorting order between ascending "
"and descending. At the bottom you find an adaptive search field which can "
"help you to find a particular search."
