" this would be the photographer, but if the image was done by an employee or"
" as work-for-hire, then the agency or company should be listed. Use the form"
" appropriate to your country. For the United States you would typically"
" follow the form of (c) {date of first publication} name of copyright owner,"
" as in \"(c)2005 John Doe.\" Note, the word \"copyright\" or the"
" abbreviation \"copr\" may be used in place of the (c) symbol. In some"
" foreign countries only the copyright symbol is recognized and the"
" abbreviation does not work. Furthermore the copyright symbol must be a full"
" circle with a \"c\" inside; using something like (c) where the parentheses"
" form a partial circle is not sufficient. For additional protection"
" worldwide, use of the phrase, \"all rights reserved\" following the notice"
" above is encouraged. In Europe you would use: Copyright {Year} {Copyright"
" owner}, all rights reserved. In Japan, for maximum protection, the"
" following three items should appear in the copyright field of the IPTC"
" Core: (a) the word, Copyright; (b) year of the first publication; and (c)"
" name of the author. You may also wish to include the phrase \"all rights"

" subjects. A way to do that in digiKam is to first check “Use standard"
" reference code” and select 10001004 which brings you to Lifestyle and"
" Leisure/Games/shogi - just to stay in our example. Then you check “Use"
" custom definition” and change the last digit of “Reference:” to 5 and the"
" text in the “Detail:” field to - say “domino”. You save this custom"
" definition to the template by clicking Add... at the right side of the"
" subjects list. Then you type in a template title (if it's a new template)"
" and save the template by clicking Add... at the right side of the templates"
" list. Don't mix up these two!"
