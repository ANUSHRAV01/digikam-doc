DAM Workflow
============

.. contents::

- Import images from camera, card reader or scanner. As long as the images are stored on the camera media, you can use that as temporary backup.

- RAW are converted to DNG and stored away into an RAW archive.

- Rate and cull, write-back metadata to the DNG archive.

- Make a backup e.g. on external drive, and optical medium, or a tape.

- Tag, comment, and geo-locate.

- Edit and improve photographs.

- For layered editing use external applications. Back in digiKam, re-apply the metadata, which was probably lost or curtailed by the other applications.

- Run the routine backup with following data-integrity checks.

- Protect processed images for copyrights with Digital Watermarking. Export to web galleries, slide shows, MPEG encode, contact sheets, printing, etc.
